    <p>This is the <strong>Free Bible Project</strong> â€” an open source initiative to make Bible reading, note-taking, and sharing accessible to everyone.</p>
    <p>This project is not possible without the works of all the other individuals who contributed to each thing and who made it publicly and freely available.</p>
    <p><strong>Free Bible Project</strong> does not take credit; we simply integrated and made existing work accessible to the public. This is our contribution to society.</p>
