## WhatsApp API Details

### How It Works
Uses WhatsApp's web URL scheme:
```
https://wa.me/[COUNTRY_CODE][PHONE_NUMBER]?text=[ENCODED_MESSAGE]
```

### Message Encoding
- URL-encoded for special characters
- Markdown formatting for bold text
- Line breaks preserved
- Emojis included

### Self-Messaging Flow
1. User enters their own number
2. App constructs WhatsApp URL
3. Opens WhatsApp Web/App
4. Pre-filled message ready to send
5. User reviews and sends to themselves

### Limitations
- Requires WhatsApp installed or WhatsApp Web access
- Message length limit (~4096 characters for URLs)
- For many notes, might need to split into multiple messages

## Tips for Users
1. **Regular Backups**: Export notes periodically
2. **Organized Notes**: Keep notes concise and meaningful
3. **Version Tracking**: Note includes which Bible version
4. **Timestamps**: Know when you wrote each note
5. **Self-Message**: Use WhatsApp to backup important notes
